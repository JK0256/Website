    <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
    <p>We learned some HTML (which I am currently using to code this website). We 
    learned some basic things like putting in pictures and configuring text in all 
    sorts of ways.</p>

    <h2>Mechanical Engineering - Rube Goldburg Machine (9/8/23-9/15/23)</h2>
    <p>We used <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad.com</a> to create an initial 
    prototype of a Rube Goldburg machine we'll be making. We need to start the machine with
    a baseball and end it with a balloon popping. We plan to roll a ball tied to a string to
    lift a block in front of a hot wheels, then allowing the hot wheels to trigger a pulley
    that will drop a tungstun cube (courtesy of Duncan) to smash the balloon.</p>
    <center><img src="cad1.png" alt="RGMachine Tinkercad Draft 1" style="width:500px;height:300;"></img><br></center>
    <p>We found some issues with our original design. For example, the original trigger of
    the final pulley was a ring hooked to a rotating shaft (that would be pushed by the hot 
    wheel), but we found that it would be too difficult to have the shaft rotate through the
    car hitting it.</p>
    <p>We started to put together our physical product, and we decided to have a pulley hanging
    off of the table, rather than creating two supports for the pulley to stand up on the table. 
    Also, we turned the ramp sideways rather than pointing it away from the pulley.</p>
    <p>Our tungstun cube is tied using a string with a ring on the end, and the ring has a rod which
    is held in place by two supports so that the rod doesn't go toward the cube, but rather so that
    the rod is yanked sideways as the ball tied to the rod falls to the floor off of the ramp.
    This was made possible in part because we turned the ramp sideways.</p>
    <p>We added another ramp for a hot wheels leading up to the ramp that the ball rolls down so
    that the hot wheels can hit the ball, and trigger the rest of the Rube Goldburg machine.</p>
    <center><img src="cad2.png" alt="RGMachine Tinkercad Revised Draft" style="width:500px;height:300;"></img><br></center>
    <p>So now the process is: hot wheels rolls down the taller ramp, the hot wheels hits the baseball on 
    lower ramp, baseball falls to floor and pulls the rod that its connected to by string, the rod gets 
    pulled out of the ring that is connected to the string that is connected to the tungstun cube, 
    and the tungstun cube falls and pops the balloon.</p>

    <p>Thankfully, it worked on our first try!</p>

    <h2>Computer Engineering - Computer Disection</h2>
    <p>For this unit, computer engineering, our main project was disecting a computer. Following the 
    directions given on Google Classroom, we identified pieces and cables in the computer that we needed 
    to detach in a certain order, and after a bit of trial and error, we managed to completely dissassemble 
    and then re-assemble the computer! Only thing being, it didn't actually turn on when we were done, 
    though we don't really know if it was supposed to work anyway.</p>

    <h2>Bioengineering - Hand</h2>
    <p>We're starting a bioengineering unit now. We saw some pretty cool videos on the uses of bioengineering, 
    such silicone artificial heart and the robot cheetah.</p>
    <p>Our main project this time was making a prosthetic hand out of cardboard, rubber bands, and string.
    It ended up being a bit of a tricky project, because our hand wasn't exactly simple or elegent. 
    We didn't use string but rather the metal wire that Duncan brought, which made it look cool but kind of 
    janky, unfortunately.</p>
    <p>The prosthetic hand was supposed to be able to grab a water bottle, and ours did manage, but admittedly 
    with some difficulty. Still, a success is a success!</p>

    <h2>Aerodynamics - Bottle Rockets</h2>
    <p>For our aerodynamics unit, we did another classic science project: bottle rockets! This turned out to 
    be quite a bit more intensive than I thought it would be, and there were definitely more details than I 
    there would be. For example: how to attach the parachute, or how to attach the cap, or how to attach the 
    fins. There were many different ways we could do each thing, but through brainstorming and a bit of trial
    and error, Duncan and I created a pretty neat rocket with a plastic bag parachute inside a bottle nose, 
    diagonally-placed fins, and quite a bit of super glue.</p>
    <center><img src="rocket.jpg" alt="Bottle rocket" style="height:200px;"></img><br></center>
    <p>Unfortunately, our rocket didn't work too well. It flew relatively straight and in an arc. The 
    diagonally-placed fins really helped with making the rocket rotate in the air while it flew. However, the 
    nose was way too heavy because of our parachute inside it, and our rocket barely flew through the air for 
    less than a second.</p>

    <h2>Environmental Engineering - Water Filters</h2>
    <p>We started with learning about environmental engineering, with a bit of an emphasis on water filteration.
    The water filteration/treatment system was actually very interesting to see. How do humans come to create 
    such complicated yet efficient systems for so mony aspects of life?</p>
    <p>After learning about the modern water filter system, we had our own chance at creating water filters. Using
    large rocks, small rocks, sand, and cotton balls, we created layers of filtering in a bottle. Duncan and I tried
    multiple different arrangements, with different bottles, but ultimately, we couldn't get the water filter to produce 
    clear water. Oddly enough, no one else from our class was able to fully filter the dirty water as well.</p>

    <h2>Electrical Engineering - Circuits</h2>
    <p>We're now starting our electrical engineering unit. We're going to be using resisters, diodes, and batteries 
    in all sorts of ways to make different kinds of circuits. Well, let's get this started.</p>
    <p>First we learned about basic circuitry using Tinkercad once again, but this time with virtual breadboards and 
    with resisters, wires, LEDs, and batteriess.</p>
    <center><img src="elecad1.png" alt="Basic circuit CAD" style="height:200px;"></img><br></center>
    <p>Parallel CAD</p>
    <center><img src="elecad2parallel.png" alt="Parallel circuit CAD" style="height:200px;"></img><br></center>
    <p>Series CAD</p>
    <center><img src="elecad2series.png" alt="Series circuit CAD" style="height:200px;"></img><br></center>
    <p>After trying the different types of circuits on TinkerCAD, we moved onto making physical circuits using breadboards, 
    wires, batteries, and Arduino, and LEDs. It was time to put the theory that we learned on TinkerCAD into practive by 
    working with the real thing. We used the Arduinos as a battery, and it required some basic programming to set it up.</p>
    <p>Starting first with basic circuits with three LEDs, we arranged everythign like we would've on the TinkerCAD, and it 
    went smoothly!</p>
    <center><img src="3led.jpg" alt="3 light circuit" style="height:200px;"></img><br></center>
    <p>After the basic series circuit, the coding aspect of the Arduino became much more important. First was making the LEDs 
    blink once, nothing too complicated.</p>
    <center><video width="500" height="350" controls="" loop="">
        <source src="blinkled.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video><br></center>
    <p>However, after making the LEDs blink once, the next exercise was to make them blink seperately in patterns. Making 
    them blink individually in different patterns proved to be an interesting exercise, but it was done relatively quickly 
    once we got the hang of it.</p>
    <center><video width="500" height="350" controls="" loop="">
        <source src="blinkpattern.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video><br></center>
    <p>Finally, for an extra exercise, we made the LED fade. Rather than simply blinking, we made it fade as it turned on 
    and off repeatedly.</p>
    <center><video width="500" height="350" controls="" loop="">
        <source src="fadeled.mp4" type="video/mp4">

    <h2>Business Engineering</h2>
    <p>The Business Engineering unit was very unlike our other subjects. Rather than hands-on engineering, we learned the 
    basic theory behind how business and engineering mesh together. We learned about the current business engineering 
    landscape, namely things such as the top engineering companies and the industries that required business engineers. It 
    was quite a shock seeing how wide the range of business engineering is in today's world. We also learned about many 
    skills, concepts, and methods needed in business engineering, such as design thinking, customer obsession, and project 
    management.</p>
    <p>Having learned the theory behind the engineering process, we moved to put these theories into practive. Our project 
    for the Business Engineering unit was creating a pitch for a product (tech, home appliances, school tools, apps, etc), 
    and presenting it to the class.</p>
    <p>For my pitch with my partner, we created a pitch for an app that we would call PenShift. PenShift, as we presented it, 
    was an app that would scan a handwritten piece of text and convert it into digital text. We pitched it with the 
    educational setting in mind, thinking of its possible benefits for students and teachers. Using PenShift would allow 
    students to avoid grueling work copying handwritten text into a digital form, and teacher would benefit by being able 
    to convert messy student handwriting into digital text, a boon for any teacher needing to grade student assignments.</p>
    <h2>Civil Engineering</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti Bridge</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Our bridge weighed 46.8 grams, the heaviest in the class.</li>
        <li>Despite our high hopes, the bridge only held 1009 grams, barely breaking a kilogram.</li>
        <li>The ratio, or score, was 21.5 grams of water held per gram of bridge.</li>
        <li>The heaviest part of our bridge was the middle, because we had designed our bridge to be stronger in 
        the center than in the sides.</li>
        <li>Our design came entirely from inspiration and speculation. Based on a project from another class, we had 
        initially planned to make a ladder-like bridge with criss-crossing supports between two long bands, becoming a 
        2D plane. However, we decided to made a triangular prism by creating two of these criss-cross ladder structures 
        and gluing them together.</li>
        <li>We had hoped that reinforcing the center would make the bridge less likely to break down the middle. For 
        that reason, we put the carabiner in the middle when we executed our project. Unfortunately, is seemed that the 
        bridge was too rigid and still too weak in the middle, as the bridge broke in the middle upon the test.</li>
        <li>As was aforementioned, the break point was the center of the bridge. Admittedly, we had not antipated it as 
        we had attempted to reinforce the middle the most of all of the bridge.</li>
        <li>I believe that a structure of bridge that could accommodate several points of pressure would be much more 
        capable of holding more weight. With the weight spread out between multiple points on the bridge, we could've 
        more evenly distributed the downward force of the water's weight.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Semester 2!</h1>
    <h2>Chemical Engineering - Making Oobleck</h2>
    <p>As with all of our units, we first learned a bit about the subject itself: jobs in the subject, specific fields 
    within the subject, and the various skills needed in these fields.</p>
    <p>The project was rather simple this time, and quite fun as well! We made oobleck, a mixture of water and corn 
    starch. Oobleck is a unique material that is hard when hit by a large force, However, it becomes like a liquid 
    when a gentle force is exerted upon it.</p>
    <p>We didn't know the exact water-corn starch ratio for making the ideal oobleck (we later learned it was 50-50), 
    so we pretty much just eyeballed it. We started by putting some corn starch first, then gradually putting in 
    water and mixing it, and just kept doing that until the oobleck was perfect. Well, except that out oobleck still 
    ended up a bit too watery anyways. So our plan didn't really go as planned, but it was all still very interesting.</p>
    <h2>Electrical Engineering/Coding - Arduino Cars</h2>
    <h3>Proposal</h3>
    <p>This unit was very different from all of our past units. Firstly, we didn't have any learning in class at the 
    beginning of the unit. After all, we already somewhat explored electrical engineering in an earlier unit, and a 
    bit of coding at the time as well. Therefore, this unit was mainly student-driven, with us having an option to 
    make either a mousetrap-powered car or an arduino car. I chose an arduino car, and our project started by having 
    to research the subject first so that we could create a project proposal. It was quite interesting seeing the 
    different things that a real engineer would have to do in order to get a project started. The proposal included 
    all sorts of things, such as a BoM (Build of Materials), Design constraints, and reasonable Milestones.</p>
    <p>The BoM was one of the more hands-on aspects of the proposal. We didn't need to actually buy the things that 
    we'd list on the BoM, because the supplies and materials are already supplied, but we did the BoM to get a look 
    at what it might actually look like.</p>
    <center><img src="bom.png" alt="Build of Materials" style="height:200px;"></img><br></center>
    <h3>Construction and Conclusion</h3>
    <p>After completing the project proposal, we started making the CAD based on the research we did. We decided to 
    make a roughly square-shaped car so that theoretically, turning would be easier, especially with the two sides of 
    wheels turning. Beyond the basic shape, there were a decent amount of things to CAD, in ways that were more 
    complicated than most of the CADs we'd done up to this point. The </p>
