    <h1>Joseph Kim - Engineering Class Website</h1>
    <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
    <p>We learned some HTML (which I am currently using to code this website). We 
    learned some basic things like putting in pictures and configuring text in all 
    sorts of ways.</p>

    <h2>Mechanical Engineering - Rube Goldburg Machine (9/8/23-9/15/23)</h2>
    <p>We used <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad.com</a> to create an initial 
    prototype of a Rube Goldburg machine we'll be making. We need to start the machine with
    a baseball and end it with a balloon popping. We plan to roll a ball tied to a string to
    lift a block in front of a hot wheels, then allowing the hot wheels to trigger a pulley
    that will drop a tungstun cube (courtesy of Duncan) to smash the balloon.</p>
    <center><img src="cad1.png" alt="RGMachine Tinkercad Draft 1" style="width:500px;height:300;"></img><br></center>
    <p>We found some issues with our original design. For example, the original trigger of
    the final pulley was a ring hooked to a rotating shaft (that would be pushed by the hot 
    wheel), but we found that it would be too difficult to have the shaft rotate through the
    car hitting it.</p>
    <p>We started to put together our physical product, and we decided to have a pulley hanging
    off of the table, rather than creating two supports for the pulley to stand up on the table. 
    Also, we turned the ramp sideways rather than pointing it away from the pulley.</p>
    <p>Our tungstun cube is tied using a string with a ring on the end, and the ring has a rod which
    is held in place by two supports so that the rod doesn't go toward the cube, but rather so that
    the rod is yanked sideways as the ball tied to the rod falls to the floor off of the ramp.
    This was made possible in part because we turned the ramp sideways.</p>
    <p>We added another ramp for a hot wheels leading up to the ramp that the ball rolls down so
    that the hot wheels can hit the ball, and trigger the rest of the Rube Goldburg machine.</p>

    <p>So now the process is: hot wheels rolls down the taller ramp, the hot wheels hits the baseball on 
    lower ramp, baseball falls to floor and pulls the rod that its connected to by string, the rod gets 
    pulled out of the ring that is connected to the string that is connected to the tungstun cube, 
    and the tungstun cube falls and pops the balloon.</p>

    <p>Thankfully, it worked on our first try!</p>

    <h2>Computer Engineering - Computer Disection</h2>
    <p>For this unit, computer engineering, our main project was disecting a computer. Following the 
    directions given on Google Classroom, we identified pieces and cables in the computer that we needed 
    to detach in a certain order, and after a bit of trial and error, we managed to completely dissassemble 
    and then re-assemble the computer! Only thing being, it didn't actually turn on when we were done, 
    though we don't really know if it was supposed to work anyway.</p>

    <h2>Bioengineering - Hand</h2>
    <p>We're starting a bioengineering unit now. We saw some pretty cool videos on the uses of bioengineering, 
    such silicone artificial heart and the robot cheetah.</p>
    <p>Our main project this time was making a prosthetic hand out of cardboard, rubber bands, and string.
    It ended up being a bit of a tricky project, because our hand wasn't exactly simple or elegent. 
    We didn't use string but rather the metal wire that Duncan brought, which made it look cool but kind of 
    janky, unfortunately.</p>
    <p>The prosthetic hand was supposed to be able to grab a water bottle, and ours did manage, but admittedly 
    with some difficulty. Still, a success is a success!</p>

    <h2>Aerodynamics - Bottle Rockets</h2>
    <p>For our aerodynamics unit, we did another classic science project: bottle rockets! This turned out to 
    be quite a bit more intensive than I thought it would be, and there were definitely more details than I 
    there would be. For example: how to attach the parachute, or how to attach the cap, or how to attach the 
    fins. There were many different ways we could do each thing, but through brainstorming and a bit of trial
    and error, Duncan and I created a pretty neat rocket with a plastic bag parachute inside a bottle nose, 
    diagonally-placed fins, and quite a bit of super glue.</p>
    <center><img src="rocket.jpg" alt="Bottle rocket" style="height:200px;"></img><br></center>
    <p>Unfortunately, our rocket didn't work too well. It flew relatively straight and in an arc. The 
    diagonally-placed fins really helped with making the rocket rotate in the air while it flew. However, the 
    nose was way too heavy because of our parachute inside it, and our rocket barely flew through the air for 
    less than a second.</p>

    <h2>Environmental Engineering - Water Filters</h2>
    <p>We started with learning about environmental engineering, with a bit of an emphasis on water filteration.
    The water filteration/treatment system was actually very interesting to see. How do humans come to create 
    such complicated yet efficient systems for so mony aspects of life?</p>
    <p>After learning about the modern water filter system, we had our own chance at creating water filters. Using
    large rocks, small rocks, sand, and cotton balls, we created layers of filtering in a bottle. Duncan and I tried
    multiple different arrangements, with different bottles, but ultimately, we couldn't get the water filter to produce 
    clear water. Oddly enough, no one else from our class was able to fully filter the dirty water as well.</p>
