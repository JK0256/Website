    <h2>Mechanical Engineering - Rube Goldburg Machine (9/8/23-9/15/23)</h2>
    <p>We used <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad.com</a> to create an initial 
    prototype of a Rube Goldburg machine we'll be making. We need to start the machine with
    a baseball and end it with a balloon popping. We plan to roll a ball tied to a string to
    lift a block in front of a hot wheels, then allowing the hot wheels to trigger a pulley
    that will drop a tungstun cube (courtesy of Duncan) to smash the balloon.</p>

    <p>We found some issues with our original design. For example, the original trigger of
    the final pulley was a ring hooked to a rotating shaft (that would be pushed by the hot 
    wheel), but we found that it would be too difficult to have the shaft rotate through the
    car hitting it.</p>
    <p>We started to put together our physical product, and we decided to have a pulley hanging
    off of the table, rather than creating two supports for the pulley to stand up on the table. 
    Also, we turned the ramp sideways rather than pointing it away from the pulley.</p>
    <p>Our tungstun cube is tied using a string with a ring on the end, and the ring has a rod which
    is held in place by two supports so that the rod doesn't go toward the cube, but rather so that
    the rod is yanked sideways as the ball tied to the rod falls to the floor off of the ramp.
    This was made possible in part because we turned the ramp sideways.</p>
    <p>We added another ramp for a hot wheels leading up to the ramp that the ball rolls down so
    that the hot wheels can hit the ball, and trigger the rest of the Rube Goldburg machine.</p>

    <p>So now the process is: hot wheels rolls down the taller ramp, the hot wheels hits the baseball on 
    lower ramp, baseball falls to floor and pulls the rod that its connected to by string, the rod gets 
    pulled out of the ring that is connected to the string that is connected to the tungstun cube, 
    and the tungstun cube falls and pops the balloon.</p>
    <p>Thankfully, it worked on our first try!</p>
